The course covers topics in multilevel modeling, including two- and three-level hierarchical linear models (HLM), random intercepts and slopes, longitudinal models and growth curve models, and some recent development in multilevel modeling.\nThe course begins with a brief overview of the ubiquity of multilevel data and the problems of using conventional methods to handle such data. It then transitions to the conceptual and statistical foundations of two-level multilevel models. Students will learn from different real data examples, and perform analyses using data of their own or provided by the instructor. Later material covers the use of multilevel modeling as a general framework for longitudinal data analysis, and other modeling considerations such as categorical data, non-hierarchical (e.g., cross-classified) data structure, and study designs. Students are also encouraged to provide input in suggesting topics to be covered for this course.\nLearning Objectives\nAfter the successful completion of this course, students will be able to . . .\nExplain the problems of analyzing clustered data with multiple regression/ANOVA;\nIdentify the types of multilevel data structure in different research scenarios;\nDescribe the statistical and conceptual foundations of multilevel modeling;\nIndependently analyze real data using statistical software for multilevel modeling;\nEvaluate published research that uses multilevel modeling;\nApply multilevel modeling in a research project, and effectively communicate findings/products in an oral research presentation or a written research report.\nPrerequisite(s): None\nCo-Requisite(s): None\nConcurrent Enrollment: None\nRecommended Preparation: PSYC 503: Regression and the General Linear Model (or a similar regression class); Experience with statistical software (preferably R)\nCourse Notes\nThis class will be fully online and will follow a flipped course design. The benefit of a flipped course model is that the lecturer can spend more time with students to go through applications of concepts and hands-on exercises of data analyses.\nThe lecture videos and course materials will be available at https://psyc575-2021fall.netlify.app by 9:00 am of each Monday, and students are expected to review these materials and the assigned readings on their own. Please note that the lecture slides only serve to guide class discussions and cannot replace the assigned readings.\nExcept for Week 1, the Tuesday meetings will be optional Q&A sessions where students can bring their questions so that the instructor and the class can discuss unclear concepts. During the mandatory Thursday meetings, students will work on quizzes, in-class exercises, and discuss questions regarding the learning materials and homework assignments. Students are expected to have reviewed the posted materials for that week before attending that week’s group exercise session.\nBefore attending the Thursday sessions, students are expected to have\nCompleted the assigned readings and reviewed the posted videos.\nIdentified questions that come up in their learning.\nStarted working on the homework problems.\nCommunication\nTo promote independence and critical thinking, students are encouraged to work through the following process for obtaining answers to course-related questions before contacting the instructor:\nconsult the course syllabus;\nconsult a classmate or post your questions on Slack;\nmeet with the instructor during office hours or Q&A sessions on Tuesdays;\nfor personal questions, email the instructor at hokchiol@usc.edu\nTechnological Proficiency and Hardware/Software Required\nR and RStudio are needed to complete the course assignments. It is highly recommended that students update to the latest versions of both software (R 4.1.0, RStudio 1.4.10XX, or above). We will discuss how to set up R and RStudio in Week 1.\nStable internet connection (for reviewing lecture videos)\nUSC technology rental program\nIf you need resources to successfully participate in your classes, such as a laptop or internet hotspot, you may be eligible for the university’s equipment rental program.

During the Thursday sessions, students will participate in group exercises. If students miss a session for any reason, they can complete the exercise posted on Blackboard within 36 hours (i.e., Friday by end of day, Pacific Time) to get credits.\nHomework problems (60%). There will be 10 homework assignments for students to apply the concepts and techniques discussed in class to analytic problems. The assignments typically involve performing data analyses using data sets of your own or provided by the instructor, and interpreting the results with some guided questions.\nYou must submit your work electronically to Blackboard by Friday 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the assigned due date. See policy on late work.\nFinal project (30%: 5% prospectus, 5% peer review, 20% presentation/final paper). You will complete a research project related to multilevel modeling, typically a research report of an empirical study using real data or a theoretical/methodological paper about certain aspects of multilevel modeling. Students interested in other project ideas (e.g., software package development) should discuss their ideas with the instructor. Each student can choose to work on their own or in a group of up to three people. Each student/group will schedule an appointment with the instructor to talk about their project during week 8 (October 5–9).\nThere are three grading components for your final project:\nProspectus (5%)\nA prospectus about your project should be submitted by Monday, October 25, 9:00 a.m. Pacific Time. The prospectus should contain a concise description of what you (or your group) plan to do for your project, including a preliminary plan for statistical analysis. The prospectus should be limited to 1 single-spaced page (excluding tables, figures, references, and other supplemental materials).\nPeer Review (5%)\nAfter the individual meeting with the instructor, each individual/group will refine their research questions and post a summary of their research questions and preliminary analyses to the dedicated forum on the Discussion Board by Friday, November 5. Each student will then give specific comments to the summaries of two other students/groups by Monday, November 15. More information on what feedback to give will be included in the grading rubric.\nFinal Presentation/Paper (20%)\nIf you choose to do a presentation, on November 30 or December 2, you or your group will give a 20-minute presentation (including Q&A) on your project. The final presentation should include the following four sections: introduction, method, results, and discussion; for methodological or theoretical work, students should follow organizations that are typical in previous papers in their areas of research. More emphasis should be put on describing the technical details of the analysis and the interpretations of the results. You will also need to submit your slides to Blackboard for grading on the day of your presentation, which should include a link to the reproducible codes for your analyses. A grading rubric on the research presentation will be posted on Blackboard.\nIf you choose to do a final paper, your paper will be due Tuesday, December 9, at 1:00 p.m. Pacific Time (the assigned final exam time for the class). The final paper should include four sections: introduction, method, results, and discussion, or comparable sections; however, more emphasis should be put on describing the technical details of the analysis and the interpretations of the results. There should also be a link to the reproducible codes for your analyses. The final paper should be 8-15 double-spaced pages of text (i.e., excluding title page, abstract, references, tables, figures, and appendices).\n\nParticipation\nParticipation accounts for 10% of the course grade. To earn full credit for participation, students should complete and turn in all in-class exercises.\nGrading Breakdown\nAssignment\n% of Grade\nIn-class exercises\n10\nHomework 1-9\n60\nProspectus\n5\nPeer Review\n5\nFinal Presentation/Paper\n20\nTOTAL\n100\nGrading Scale\nCourse final grades will be determined using the following scale\nA\n93-100\nA-\n89-92\nB+\n85-88\nB\n81-84\nB-\n77-80\nC+\n73-76\nC\n70-72\nC-\nBelow 70 (failing)\nAssignment Submission\nThe assignments should be submitted through Blackboard by Friday at 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time, before the class starts.\nGrading Timeline\nGenerally, all graded work will be returned no later than one week from the submission deadline. However, given the high number of students in the class, the instructor may only grade selected questions in each assignment. Solutions will be posted so that students can check their own work.\nLate work\nLate work will be penalized by a 10% deduction in the assignment grade every 24 hours late unless due to an emergency excused by the instructor. Email the instructor as soon as possible to discuss alternate arrangements due to an emergency.\nTechnology in the classroom\nPhones\nYour phone should be turned off or in silent mode (not on vibrate), and should not be used in the classroom.\nTablets and Laptops\nDuring lecture time in the classroom, students can use tablets and laptops only for purposes of viewing course materials and taking notes. Use of tablets and laptops for note taking is strongly discouraged as it may distract both yourself and your peers (Sana, Weston, & Cepeda, 2013). During the in-class exercises, students should use their laptops to complete the assignments.\nAttendance\nStudents are expected to attend all Thursday class sessions on time. If they miss a session, they should complete the class exercises and turn in their work within the timeframe specified in Description and Assessment of Assignments.\nClassroom Norms\nFrom USC’s FALL 2021 GUIDE: Return To Campus Protocols document,\n\nStudents, faculty and staff need to be aware of COVID-19 symptoms, and are required to complete a daily self-screening via Trojan Check before coming onto campus or leaving their on-campus residence.\n\n\nStudents, faculty, and staff are required to wear masks indoors, including classrooms – and no food or drink is permitted during class\n\nThe following applies to both in-person and online communications (e.g., Slack discussions and email communications)\nRespect each other’s views.\nIn written communication messages, make sure they are something you could say to someone to their face.\nRecognize and/or remember that we have different backgrounds. \nCriticize ideas, not individuals or groups.\nEither support statements with evidence, or speak from personal experience.\nCOVID-19 Guidance\nStudents should consult the latest COVID-19 testing and health protocol requirements for on-campus courses.
