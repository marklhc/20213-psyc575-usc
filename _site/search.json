The course covers topics in multilevel modeling including two- and three-level hierarchical linear models (HLM), random intercepts and slopes, longitudinal models and growth curve models, as well as some recent development in multilevel modeling.\nThe course begins with a brief overview of the ubiquity of multilevel data and the problems of using conventional methods to handle such data and then transitions to the conceptual and statistical foundations of two-level multilevel models. Students will be exposed to real data examples and are required to perform analyses using real data of their own or that the instructor provides. Later material covers the use of multilevel modeling as a general framework for longitudinal data analysis, and other modeling considerations such as categorical data, non-hierarchical (e.g., cross-classified) data structure, and study designs. Students are also encouraged to provide input in suggesting topics to be covered for this course.\nLearning Objectives\nAfter the successful completion of this course, students will be able to . . .\nExplain the problems of analyzing clustered data with multiple regression/ANOVA;\nIdentify the types of multilevel data structure in different research scenarios;\nDescribe the statistical and conceptual foundations of multilevel modeling;\nIndependently analyze real data using statistical software for multilevel modeling;\nEvaluate published research that uses multilevel modeling;\nApply multilevel modeling in a research project, and effectively communicate findings/products in an oral research presentation or a written research report.\nPrerequisite(s): None\nCo-Requisite(s): None\nConcurrent Enrollment: None\nRecommended Preparation: PSYC 503: Regression and the General Linear Model (or a similar regression class); Experience with statistical software (preferably R)\nCourse Notes\nThis class will be fully online and will follow a flipped course design. The benefit of a flipped course model is that the lecturer can spend more time with students to go through applications of concepts and hands-on exercises of data analyses.\nThe lecture videos and course materials will be available at  by 9:00 am of each Monday, and students are expected to review these materials and the assigned readings on their own. Please note that the lecture slides only serve to guide class discussions and cannot replace the assigned readings.\nWith the exception of Week 1, the Tuesday meetings will be optional Q&A sessions where students can bring their questions so that the instructor and the class can discuss unclear concepts. During the mandatory Thursday meetings, students will work on quizzes, in-class exercises, and discuss questions regarding the learning materials and homework assignments. Students are expected to have reviewed the posted materials for that week before attending that week’s synchronous session.  Before attending the Thursday sessions, students are expected to have\nCompleted the assigned readings and reviewed the posted videos.\nIdentified questions that come up in their learning.\nStarted working on the homework problems.\n\n\n\n",

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.\nWhen you click the Knit button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:\n\nNote: R is case sensitive. So Cars and cars are different.\n\n\n\nsummary(cars)\n\n\n     speed           dist       \n Min.   : 4.0   Min.   :  2.00  \n 1st Qu.:12.0   1st Qu.: 26.00  \n Median :15.0   Median : 36.00  \n Mean   :15.4   Mean   : 42.98  \n 3rd Qu.:19.0   3rd Qu.: 56.00  \n Max.   :25.0   Max.   :120.00  \n\nYAML options\nChunk options\n\nIncluding Plots\nYou can also embed plots, for example:\n\n\n\nNote that the echo = FALSE parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.\nInstall packages\n\nStudents struggle with install vs library every semester, and keep including their install code in the RMarkdown report.
